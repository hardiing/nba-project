# nba-project

A Python web scraping program that pulls data from basketball-reference.com. Currently it is just scraping player stats from the 2020-2021 season, displaying the first 10 results in the IDE and all results to a .csv file. I plan on eventually pulling in other data sets and making a front-end aspect to the project.
